        <h2>Begining</h2>
        <p>
            The origins of the Umbrella Corporation lie with the eugenics movements that dominated Europe and North American debate in the early 20th century. Its three most prominent founding members were Dr. Oswell E. Spencer, The Earl Spencer; Dr. Edward Ashford, 5th Earl Ashford, and Dr. James Marcus, who were university classmates, with further early work from Marcus' protégé, Brandon Bailey; the 16th Earl Beardsley and his daughter, Mylène; and France's House of Henry, of which Christine and her father belonged. All were virologists with some associations with the eugenics movement either themselves or by association to another prominent figure. Umbrella's immediate pre-history truly begins in 1966, when Dr. Marcus developed a hypothesis that a mythical West African flower known as Stairway of the Sun bestowed powers to its consumers by a mutagenic viral infection. In a trip to the Ndipaya tribal lands, the fabled flower was discovered in an underground garden and a virus discovered within it. However, flowers cultivated in the United States failed to replicate the virus. Requiring significant funding beyond their aristocratic links to bring about their eugenics dream, Spencer formed Umbrella Pharmaceuticals on behalf of Ashford and an indifferent Marcus and established a base in the Ndipaya garden so Progenitor samples could be transported over the Atlantic instead. Requiring more money, the three agreed to a plan later known as the "t-Virus Project", where they would independently develop strains of Progenitor to sell to the US military as a weapon.
            The t-Virus Project expanded considerably over this period thanks to research led of Dr. William Birkin at the end of the 1970s, inspired by Marcus' independent but otherwise unrelated work in 1978, which saw the abandonment of t-Virus as a weapon of death and instead utilized its mutagenic properties to keep the infected alive in a mentally-damaged, homicidal and cannibalistic state capable of maintaining activity after a cardiac arrest.
            The Umbrella Corporation's name and symbol came from the Four Houses' "umbrella" symbol. Spencer had encountered this symbol while studying under Mother Miranda during his time in a Village in Eastern Europe.

            As Umbrella's power increased, the founding circle began warring amongst themselves. Dr. Ashford was the first victim, killed in 1968 by his own prototype t-Virus in an accident believed to be masterminded by Spencer. Marcus became unpopular with the executive body due to his use of executive trainees as guinea pigs and was eventually executed by the Umbrella Security Service in 1988. Edward's son, Dr. Alexander Ashford, was not a virologist and so became an irrelevance to the bio-weapons project; though his genetically-engineered daughter Alexia restored the Ashford prestige, both became infected with the experimental t-Veronica Virus and disappeared from public life, believed dead. The surviving son, Alfred, grew into minor administrative roles, his family no longer a threat to Spencer. Beyond three founders in Spencer's circle, Dr. Brandon Bailey was forcibly kept in Africa until his execution in 1998 to prevent a security breach. Drs. Henry and Beardsley would die at some point in the early 1990s and their respective daughters, Christine and Mylène, took control of their facilities in Europe. Although Mylène Beardsley had plans to take over the company she was not a serious threat.
            With the realization of a rare immunity to the virus, the t-Virus Project expanded again in the early 1980s as laboratories across the world developed chimeric animals that would be sent out by militaries to kill survivors, known as Bio Organic Weapons. By this period, the Umbrella Corporation itself had grown to such size that it required regional subsidiaries to handle operations. Umbrella USA held control over American facilities and administration and was based in Chicago, with the Arklay Laboratory being its main facility for bio-weapons research until the opening of the NEST in 1991 for research on the G-Virus, a Progenitor viral strain capable of repairing dead tissue and could in theory transform infected people into superhumans just as Spencer wished.Umbrella Europe was formed during the 1980s out of the partial-integration of national branches in Western Europe out of frustration of Umbrella USA's influence over research. Umbrella Europe pioneered the Nemesis Project, a plan to create an intelligent parasite that would serve as a replacement brain to go around Umbrella USA's failure to prevent the t-Virus from causing brain damage and loss of intelligence. This plan ran alongside Umbrella USA's Tyrant Project to develop a superhuman weapon, and would be integrated in 1998 to create the Nemesis-T Type as a European achievement, while Umbrella USA's own counter to it was the Talos Project to develop an organic computer link so a sophisticated AI could pilot a Tyrant instead.
            Aside from the two chief continental groups was Umbrella Japan Co., Ltd. which administrated Umbrella's research into biotechnology and machinery for this purpose in 1987. At the end of the decade, Umbrella also acquired the Queen Zenobia; Queen Dido and Queen Semiramis for the Paraguas Line Company, which would transport bioweaponry overseas along with the separately purchased Spencer Rain. Planes would also transport bioweapons cargo via the Antarctic Transport Terminal, a facility first opened in the 1960s for the Ashfords' research, but would be almost solely used as an international shipping depot following the disappearance of Dr. Alexia Ashford in 1983. Nonetheless, Umbrella USA oversaw the most successful sectors of Umbrella, with a third of Raccoon City's 100,000 inhabitants working for its subsidiaries active there.
