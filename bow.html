    <div class="tresc"><p>Bio Organic Weapons (B.O.W. for short) are genetically-altered organisms created with the intent of either being used as military and paramilitary weapons, or were created to further research into military and paramilitary weapons. This definition is rigid, and so does not include mutants created due to outbreaks, who are termed "Irregular Mutants".</p></div>

        <h2>Tyrants</h2>
        <h3>T-002</h3>
        <p>This Tyrant was part of the Arklay Laboratory's quest to develop the "ultimate life form". The T-002 and its associated Tyrant Project was, at the time, top-secret. T-002 was found to have intelligence almost at the same level as its human, pre-infected form, which would have allowed it to follow a wide variety of commands beyond that of the Hunter models had its life not been drastically cut short.</p>

        <h3>T-103</h3>
        <p>This Tyrant was a series of mass-produced human bio organic weapons. Produced in 1998 from modified clones of the T-002 Tyrant, the T-103 was the posthumous completion of the Tyrant Project's goal.
        T-103s possessed intelligence close to that of normal humans, and could follow orders impossible for more primitive B.O.W.s. Consequently, the T-103 models were used as bodyguards, assassins sent to hunt specific individuals, Umbrella agents sent to acquire important objects, and hard-muscle for tackling armed opposition. 
        The reason that the development code was "103" rather than "003" is likely a point to separate it from its predecessors, marking it as the true mass-produced Tyrant it was, rather than another prototype.</p>

        <h3>Nemesis-T Type</h3>
        <p>Nemesis-T Type was a series of experimental Bio Organic Weapons. Created by Umbrella Europe's No. 6 Laboratory, the Nemesis-T Types were the culmination of the Nemesis Project with the successful implantation of NE-Î± parasites within T-103 hosts, presenting Umbrella with a highly intelligent and powerful creature. Several Nemesis-T Types were produced, though only one - Nemesis-T02 - is known to have experienced combat. This individual was sent in Raccoon City and nicknamed the "Pursuer".
